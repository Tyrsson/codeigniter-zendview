<div id="pods"><!-- Parent container that takes the width of the page -->

	<!--
	"Pages" is the most "robust" of the group thus far. Since pages can have children,
	I'm using a CSS class of 'parent', and injecting a <span> container to show that.
	(I only show top level pages.) The CSS 'alt' class simply makes the list "striped"
	with a color. If you know of a different way to do that, I'm game. I've turned off
	this functionality thru the CSS for now, as I haven't decided I even want it.
